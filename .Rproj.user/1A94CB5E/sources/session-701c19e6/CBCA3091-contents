# BTprocessR2: updated codes and full working functions for the BTprocessR package from Henry Ferguson-Gow

The original repository for BTprocessR longer available or maintained on
GitHub. Here, I have re- compiled the functions and updated them for the
latest version of BayesTraits (V. 4, Pagel et al.Â 2022),
<doi:10.1038/s41467-022-28595-z>. This is a draft (some functions still
need updates). Functions updated so far include: createCountsTable,
scalarSearch, meanBranches, and jpp2 (extended to include the fabric
model)

## Installing package **BTprocessR2**

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tiago-simoes/BayesTraitsRtools")
```
